Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a progressive condition affecting kidney function over time. Early detection and proper classification can significantly improve treatment strategies. This dataset provides medical records of patients, including serum creatinine levels, estimated GFR values, and classified CKD stages.

🔹 Key Features:

Serum Creatinine (SC): Indicator of kidney function.
Age: Important for GFR calculation.
GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate): Estimated using the CKD-EPI equation.
CKD Stage: Categorized into six stages (0-5) based on GFR values.
